The WarBerry was built with one goal in mind; to be used in red teaming engagement where we want to obtain as much information 
as possible in a short period of time with being as stealth as possible. 
Just find a network port and plug it in. The scripts have been designed in a way that the approach is targeted to avoid noise 
in the network that could lead to detection and to be as efficient as possible. 
The WarBerry script is a collection of scanning tools put together to provide that functionality.


####Usage

To get a list of all options and switches use:

sudo python warberry.py -h
